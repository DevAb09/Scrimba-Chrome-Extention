**MyLeads Chrome Extension**

This is a simple Chrome Extension that allows you to save and manage your favorite links. You can add links manually by typing them into the input field, or you can add the link of the current tab by clicking on the "Save Tab" button. You can also delete all your saved links by double-clicking on the "Delete All" button.

**How it Works **ðŸ’»****

The Chrome Extension uses the Chrome Extension API to access the active tab's URL and saves the links in the extension's local storage. The render() function is used to display the saved links in an unordered list below the input field. The user can add new links to the list by typing them into the input field and clicking on the "Save" button. The user can also save the link of the active tab by clicking on the "Save Tab" button. The user can delete all the saved links by double-clicking on the "Delete All" button.

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to save and manage website URLs. You can save URLs by clicking the "Save" button or by clicking the "Tab" button to save the current tab's URL. You can also delete saved URLs by double-clicking the "Delete" button.
To use this Chrome Extension, follow these simple steps:
Install the Extension

    1. Download the extension's source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.
    2. Open Google Chrome and go to the "chrome://extensions" URL in a new tab.
    3. Make sure the "Developer mode" switch is toggled on, located in the top-right corner of the page.
    4. Click the "Load unpacked" button located in the top-left corner of the page.
    5. In the file browser window that appears, navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension's source code and click "Select folder".
    The extension should now be installed and visible in your list of Chrome extensions.

Note: Manually installing extensions can be less secure than installing them from the Chrome Web Store, so it's important to only install extensions from trusted sources.
